# Lost Reflections
Unity project made in a week for Brackey's Game Jam 2021.1

Out of 1889 submissions, mine ranked #103 for game design, #5 in audio, and #1 for graphics. The overall ranking was #43. Rankings and community feedback can be viewed here: https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5/rate/929033

The game is available to play online at its itch.io page: https://countthrepe.itch.io/lost-reflections

This was my first game jam. I reached out to two friends and initiated this project. One did all the visual art and one did all the sfx and music, and they both did an amazing job. I assembled everything in Unity and developed all the code for player combat, enemy AI, environment interaction, background parallax, changing soundscapes, camera follow, etc. I did 100% of the level design, and was the main creative lead for the overall game design, though that was much more collaborative. I also managed our team, giving out tasks and setting goals for both of my friends.

Looking back at it, I would redo some ui feedback, change the camera follow behaviour, fine tune the movement to make it more consistent, and do a lot more playtesting to tune the difficulty. I would also be more clear in communication, because there were some hiccups due to differing expectations.

This jam was a ton of fun, and I would like to do more game development going forward. I think my next project might be something in VR with an Oculus Rift S headset.
